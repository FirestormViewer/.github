It is **IMPORTANT** to not disclose this in-world, or to share it with anyone outside of The Firestorm Team or Linden Lab.

If the issue is related to Second Life, and not the Firestorm viewer, please report the issue to Linden Lab by following [their security issues guide](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Security_issues).<br/>
The Firestorm Team **CANNOT** assist with Second Life related security issues, other than to point you in the right direction.
